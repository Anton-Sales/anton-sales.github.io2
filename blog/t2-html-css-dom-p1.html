<h2> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
	<p>A good analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM is the house model. Your room being the webpage, bed, desk, shelf, books, etc would be the objects (elements). CSS being the decoration, paints, flowers, art, etc. DOM (Document Object Model) provides a structural representation of the document, enabling the developer to modify its content and visual representation. Essentially, it connects webpages to programming languages and scripts. </p>
