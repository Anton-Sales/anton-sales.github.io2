			<h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
			<p>
				A good analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM is the house model. Your room being the webpage, bed, desk, shelf, books, etc
				would be the objects (elements). CSS being the decoration, paints, flowers, art, etc. DOM (Document Object Model) provides
				a structural representation of the document, enabling the developer to modify its content and visual representation.
				Essentially, it connects webpages to programming languages and scripts.

			<h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
			<p>
				Everything on a webpage is a box, images, text, header, etc. By thinking of things in terms of boxes we can easily re arrange
				things to give users a different experience.

			<h3>What is the box model?</h3>
			<div class="boxmodelcontainer">
				<p>
					It is that invisible box model around the content. This model consist of, content, padding, border and margin. We have our
					content which is in the centre of the model. This is the image or text that appears on our website. The next layer outwards
					is our padding, it clears an area around the content, that protects the content directly. The border is any kind of
					line surrounding the box, if present. Lastly, the outer layer, margin, is the space around the border and the space
					between other elements.
