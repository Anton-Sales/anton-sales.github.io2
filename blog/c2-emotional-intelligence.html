            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>
                Start the journey with optimism. Emotional competence are not innate talents; they are learned abilities. I have learned
                that emotional intelligence is to monitor one’s feelings, emotions and, actions in a third-person perspective.
                Seeing it clearly and objectively to guide one’s thinking and actions.
            </p>
            <h4>Goleman’s emotional structure into five domains</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Self-awareness</li>
                <li>Self-regulation</li>
                <li>Motivation</li>
                <li>Empathy</li>
                <li>Social Skills</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In two groups, we have, intrapersonal and interpersonal. The first three as intrapersonal intelligence. Meaning that, it
                takes place within one’s mind. The last two as interpersonal intelligence, relating to relationships or communication
                between people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is not an innate talent, it something that you can deliberately acquire with practice. Which is what
                I’m most looking forward to in mindful meditation.
            </p>
            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>
                I found it improved my overall cognitive thinking. For the first minute I found my rhythm of breathing, the second minute
                I found myself ‘just being’. I open my eyes noticing that it has not been two minutes, but eight! I was in
                the ‘zone’. The feeling of being in the zone has always put a grin in my face, whether it being sports, driving,
                gaming, you name it. In addition to that mseditation is amongst it. I'm excited to achieve this feeling for
                programming soon.
