                        Start the journey with optimism. Emotional competence are not innate talents; they are learned abilities. I have learned
                        that emotional intelligence is to monitor one’s feelings, emotions and, actions in a third-person
                        perspective. Seeing it clearly and objectively to guide one’s thinking and actions.

                        <p>In two groups, we have, intrapersonal and interpersonal. The first three as intrapersonal intelligence.
                            Meaning that, it takes place within one’s mind. The last two as interpersonal intelligence, relating
                            to relationships or communication between people.

                            Emotional intelligence is not an innate talent, it something that you can deliberately acquire with practice. Which is what
                            I’m most looking forward to in mindful meditation.

                            I found it improved my overall cognitive thinking. For the first minute I found my rhythm of breathing, the second minute
                            I found myself ‘just being’. I open my eyes noticing that it has not been two minutes, but eight!
                            I was in the ‘zone’. The feeling of being in the zone has always put a grin in my face, whether
                            it being sports, driving, gaming, you name it. In addition to that mseditation is amongst it.
                            I'm excited to achieve this feeling for programming soon.
