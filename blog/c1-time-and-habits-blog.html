    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>After reading and watching from the resources provided, what I found most interesting to try was meditation, tiny habits, and pomodoro
            technique. These timebox and habit technique were used to finished this question set.
        </p>

    <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>The benefits of meditation sparked my interest the most. Gaining short and long term benefits such as, better focus, less anxiety, more
            creativity, better memory, less stress and so much more! In a short period of time, these benefits are not to be missed.
         </p>
        
    <h3>what worked for you?</h3>
        <p>Meditation has worked magnificently on giving myself a mental reset in times of need. Though I don't do it often enough, it has served
            it's purpose when need be. Though I'm not the greatest at building habits, I am looking to improve techniques, to daily habits in the near
            future.
        </p>

    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>I will experiment with the combination of tiny habits, meditation and the pomodoro technique. I think these three compatible with each
            other in a way that would be beneficial for productivity. Starting off with the pomodoro technique, 25 minutes each task followed by
            the tiny habits, and end with meditation. "After twenty-five minutes, I will meditate for two minutes."
