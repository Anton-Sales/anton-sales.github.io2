                    <p>After reading and watching from the resources provided, what I found most interesting to try was meditation,
                        tiny habits, and pomodoro technique. These timebox and habit technique were used to finished this
                        question set.

                    <p>The benefits of meditation sparked my interest the most. Gaining short and long term benefits such as,
                        better focus, less anxiety, more creativity, better memory, less stress and so much more! In a short
                        period of time, these benefits are not to be missed.

                    <p>Meditation has worked magnificently on giving myself a mental reset in times of need. Though I don't
                        do it often enough, it has served it's purpose when need be. Though I'm not the greatest at building
                        habits, I am looking to improve techniques, to daily habits in the near future.

                    <p>I will experiment with the combination of tiny habits, meditation and the pomodoro technique. I think
                        these three compatible with each other in a way that would be beneficial for productivity. Starting
                        off with the pomodoro technique, 25 minutes each task followed by the tiny habits, and end with meditation.
                        "After twenty-five minutes, I will meditate for two minutes."
