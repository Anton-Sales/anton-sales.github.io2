            <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
            <p>
                Code, test, and refine, has helped me alot through the coding process. Rather than coding big changes and testing just to
                see a bug, I would have to retrace my code and waste alot more time. Instead, I add little changes and see
                what works and what doesn't.
