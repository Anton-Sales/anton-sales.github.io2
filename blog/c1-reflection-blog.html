                    <p>
                        From my experience so far, my perspective on EDA has been all positive. It has been such a welcoming environment that puts
                        you in ease, but also keeps you on your toes. EDA provides you with great information relevent to
                        what you are looking for. An example of this, is when I was shown their webinar. It was amazing!
                        Everything that I wanted to know appeared before my very eyes. In Sheerif's fireside chat (similar
                        to a webinar), he mentions "We're in this together", which I honestly think what a great community
                        should have.

                        A fast paced learning environment in a cohort. Sheerif covered this topic particularly well, by saying "if you want to go
                        fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." DBC/EDA covers both simultaneously. Patience
                        and progressions is one of the things that I also found interesting. Learning patiently will suddenly
                        become second nature. It's reasurring to know both DBC & EDA hold their values strongly.

                        By approaching with an open mindset. Finding ways to improve with my cohort, who either have more or less experience than
                        me. Together, we will face challenges wholeheartedly and strive to be our best selves.

                        My expectations have not changed. It seems that the further I explore about DBC/EDA, the passion to be in this community
                        substantially increases. If my expectations will change, I believe it will be beneficial.

                        I am thrilled! To be part of this supportive community is a great learning opportunity. I will be looking for ways to improve
                        not only for my self, but with the team. To tackle daily challenges that is presented to us and learn
                        from one another. I am nervous (in a good way), I will be taking advantage of this opportunity to
                        learn and grow as a person.
