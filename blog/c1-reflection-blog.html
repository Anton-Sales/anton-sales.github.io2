    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>    
        <p>From my experience so far, my perspective on EDA has been all positive. It has been such a welcoming environment that puts you in ease,
        but also keeps you on your toes. EDA provides you with great information relevent to what 
        you are looking for. An example of this, is when I was shown their webinar. It was amazing! Everything that I wanted to know appeared
        before my very eyes. In Sheerif's fireside chat (similar to a webinar), he mentions "We're in this together", which I honestly think what
        a great community should have.
        </p>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3> 
        <p>A fast paced learning environment in a cohort. Sheerif covered this topic particularly well, by saying "if you want to go fast, go alone.
        If you want to go far, go together." DBC/EDA covers both simultaneously. Patience and progressions is one of the things that I also
        found interesting. Learning patiently will suddenly become second nature. It's reasurring to know both DBC & EDA hold their values
        strongly.
        </p>
    
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
        <p>By approaching with an open mindset. Finding ways to improve with my cohort, who either have more or less experience than me. Together, 
        we will face challenges wholeheartedly and strive to be our best selves.
        </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p>My expectations have not changed. It seems that the further I explore about DBC/EDA, the passion to be in this community substantially 
        increases. If my expectations will change, I believe it will be beneficial.
        </p>
    
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
        <p> I am thrilled! To be part of this supportive community is a great learning opportunity. I will be looking for ways to improve not only
        for my self, but with the team. To tackle daily challenges that is presented to us and learn from one another. I am nervous (in a good way),
        I will be taking advantage of this opportunity to learn and grow as a person.
