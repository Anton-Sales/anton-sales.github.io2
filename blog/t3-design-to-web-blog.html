                    <p>A responsive website is a site that can adapt to any screen size, whether it being tablets, phones, desktops,
                        tv's, consoles, etc. Using CSS media queries, the site would switch to accommodate the screen resolution
                        image size, and scripting abilities. This is important because it would eliminate different design
                        and development phases for every single device.

                    <p>More people today are using their mobile devices for social media, browsing the web, and shopping online
                        than ever before. Mobile first design is sure way to get the hardest part out of the way. The name
                        itself explains it all. To design an online experience for mobile before designing it for desktop
                        web. This is important as it is the primary means of users accessing websites and this will only
                        keep on increasing over the years to come.

                    <p>Frameworks are a software to help you perform a specific task without the repetition of you doing so.
                        For example, I tell you to cut a tree specifically 154cm from the ground. Doing so is not a problem,
                        but if I ask you to do the same thing with 1000 other trees, it would be time consuming. A framework
                        would be you carrying around a ruler exactly 154cm high to perform this the specific task. The pros
                        of using a framework is that you can do more in less time, developing becomes easier, faster and
                        efficient. The cons are that you learn the framework but the language. You are also limited on how
                        the frameworks limits, in other words it can't be modified outside its capabilities.

                <div class="right">
                    <p> Wireframing is a way to design a website like a blueprint. It is used to represent a visual guide of
                        the content and functionality of a website you are going to be making. We use it as it can provide
                        great advantages. It can provide as an early visual review for the client or users can review it
                        as a prototype. It is the concept design on which the client approves on and the designer to build
                        confidence on.
